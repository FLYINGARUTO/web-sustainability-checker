# Lighthouse Sustainability Extension

This repository contains **custom gatherers, audits, and configuration files** developed as part of my MSc dissertation project at the University of Glasgow.  

The purpose of these extensions is to evaluate sustainability-related aspects of web performance using [Google Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse).

## Contents
- `/gatherers` â†’ Custom gatherers for collecting sustainability-related data  
- `/audits` â†’ Custom audits to assess data against sustainability criteria  
- `/configs` â†’ Configuration files to run the custom audits  

## Usage
1. Clone the official Lighthouse repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse
   cd lighthouse
2. Copy the contents of this repo into the corresponding directories in Lighthouse (gatherers, audits, configs).

3. Update config paths
In the config file (e.g., green-config2.js), update the paths so that they correctly point to the location of your custom gatherers and audits.

4. Run Lighthouse with the custom config:
   ```bash
   lighthouse --config-path=YOUR_CONFIG_PATH/green-config2.js --view https://www.WEBSITE_HERE.com
   #Replace YOUR_CONFIG_PATH with the path to configuration files of this repository.
   #Replace https://www.WEBSITE_HERE.com with the target website you want to audit.

## ðŸ”„ Reproducibility

To help replicate the results of this project, two additional scripts are provided:

1. Batch Lighthouse Runner
**File:** `batch-lighthouse.sh`

- Runs Lighthouse audits in batch mode for a list of websites(add it to the **urls** in the file).  
- For each website, a JSON report will be generated in the specified output folder.  

**Example usage:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x YOUR_PATH/batch-lighthouse.sh
   YOUR_PATH/batch-lighthouse.sh


2. JSON to CSV Converter

File: json2csv.py

Extracts relevant metrics from the Lighthouse JSON reports and compiles them into a CSV file.
Before running it, remember to configure the report folder address.

## Notes

This repo only contains the modified and newly created files.
